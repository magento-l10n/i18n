# F.A.Q.

1. **I'm interested in translations for Magento Commerce. Where I can find translations for it?**
    
    Translations for all Magento editions are stored and managed in [the same project](https://crowdin.com/project/magento-2).
    
2. **I need translations for Magento 2.x.x. What branch or package version I should use?**

    Actual translations for **all** Magento versions available at master branch at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/magento-2). Therefore, each version of language package released as part of Magento Translation initiative contains phrases for **all** versions.
    
3. **I need translations for modules that are not part of Magento core. Where I can find it?**

    Magento product releases includes several additional modules developed by Magento core engineers (e.g. Page Builder), Magento Community (e.g. Multi-Source Inventory) or vendor modules (e.g. Dotmailer or Klarna). From the begin we starting translation project only for Community-driven Multi-Source Inventory. For actual list of ongoing project please see [projects list](PROJECTS.md#Translations).
    
4. **I need translation for a language that is not listed at Crowdin. What should I do?**
   
    Please create an issue at GitHub repository which holds translations (e.g. [magento-l10n/i18n-magento2](https://github.com/magento-l10n/i18n-magento2), [magento-l10n/i18n-msi](https://github.com/magento-l10n/i18n-msi)) or send a mail to magento-l10n@adobe.com.
